#Simple Module Import in Python
To introduce modules, in particular `sys` and the `import` statement, the following problems were solved:  
0. Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2  
1. Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result  
2. Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.  
3. Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments (to compare with infinite_add in C)  
4. Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).  
5. Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.  
6. Write a program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basics operations.  
7. Write a program that prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output. Your program should be maximum 2 lines long. You are not allowed to use print or import sys in your file 101-easy_print.py.  
8. Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the given Python bytecode.  
9. Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line. Your program should be maximum 3 lines long. You are not allowed to use:
        any loops
        any conditional statements
        str.join()
        any string literal
        any system calls
