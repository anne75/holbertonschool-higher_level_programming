## Introduction to SQL

All this project was done using`mysql-5.5`.  
As a first step in SQL, the SQL statements we were introduced to are:
- `SHOW` database, table  
- `CREATE` database, table  
- `DROP` database, table  
- `ALTER` table  
- simple `SELECT` statements  
- `COUNT` and `AVG`  
- `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `LIMIT`  

Always use `IF NOT EXISTS`.
