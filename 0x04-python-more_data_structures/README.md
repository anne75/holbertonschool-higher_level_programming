## Sequences, lambda function and map
This project builds on the previous one. `set`s and `dict`s are introduced, as well as lambda functions and `map()`. The following problems were solved:  

0. Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.  
1. Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.  
2. Write a function that makes the addition of all unique integers in a list.  
3. Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.  
4. Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.  
5. Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.  
6. Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.  
7. Write a function that replace or add key/value in a dictionary.  
8. Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.  
9. Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2  
10. Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.  
11. Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops. (use `map()`, write the code in 3 lines or less)  
12. Write a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (\<score>, \<weight>) in a list.  
13. Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using `map`.  
14. Write a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.  
15. Create two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
