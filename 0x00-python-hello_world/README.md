##Hello World
For our very first day of python, some bash was in order. Of course, we are not allowed to any IDE before we know how to do things in the shell. Who would have it any other way ? We had to solve the following problem:  
0. Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.  
1. Write a Shell script that runs Python code (inline command)  
2. Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line, use `print`  
3. Complete some code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by a string, followed by a new line. Use only `print` and the new `format`.
4. Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits. Use only `print` and the new `format`.
5. Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 in a specific format, the last number being only followed by a new line. We can only use `print` twice, with `format`. We cannot use variables or import any module.  
6. Complete some code to print Welcome to Holberton School! You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements. You have to use the variables str1 and str2 in your new line of code  
7. Complete some source code, using string slicing.  
8. More slicing.  
9. Write a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python", by TimPeters, followed by a new line.  
10. Write a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line. Use the function write from the sys module, print to stderr, exit with the status code 1.  
11. Write a script that compiles a Python script file. Only compile, it should create a file in .pyc in the current directory.  
12. Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:  
  3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 LOAD_CONST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 (98)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 LOAD_FAST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 (a)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 LOAD_FAST&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 (b)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 BINARY_POWER  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 BINARY_ADD  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 RETURN_VALUE
