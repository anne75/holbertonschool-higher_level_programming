##First statements
For this second day of python, we had to learn about `if` statements, looping... Basically all the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/controlflow.html) on the topic. We solved the following problems. Any time we had to print something, it was required to use `print` and `format`.    
0. Complete a source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.  
1. Complete a source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.  
2. Write a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.  
3. Write a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line, except letters e and q.  
4. Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal in a specific format. You can only use one loop in your code. You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable. You are not allowed to import any module.  
5. Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 in a specific format, the last number being only followed by a new line. We can only use `print` twice, with `format`. We cannot use variables or import any module.    
6. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space except for the last one. The two digits must be different. We can only use `print` 3 times, 2 loops, no variables, no import.  
7. Write a function that checks for lowercase character, only using `ord`.  
8. Write a function that print a string in uppercase followed by a new line, using only `ord`.  
9. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number. No import.  
10. Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.  
11. Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.  
12. Fizz Buzz  
13. Write a program that prints the alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.  
14. Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n. No import.  
15. Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode.
