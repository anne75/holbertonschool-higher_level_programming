#Introduction to Exception handling
In this project we practise exception handling for the first time. Problems are all solved in a way that requires the use of `try/except`.  
0. Write a function that prints x elements of a list.  
1. Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().  
2. Write a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.  
3. Write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.  
4. Write a function that divides element by element 2 lists.  
5. Write a function that raises a type exception.  
6. Write a function that raises a name exception with a message.  
7. Write a function that prints an integer if the argument is one and returns either `True` or `False`.  
8. Write a function that executes a function safely, and prints a message on `stderr` if the function called raised an exception.  
9. Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode:  
10. Create three C functions that print some basic info about Python lists, Python bytes an Python float objects.
