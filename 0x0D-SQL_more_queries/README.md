Starting on creating users, granting privileges and subqueries in mysql.  
All the questions were done on `mysql-5.7`.  
The following SQL aspects were used:  
- `SHOW GRANTS`  
- `CREATE` user
- `GRANT` some privileges on some databases, tables for some user.  
- `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY` and `FOREIGN` `KEY` constraints.  
- `JOIN`, retrieve values from multiple tables.
