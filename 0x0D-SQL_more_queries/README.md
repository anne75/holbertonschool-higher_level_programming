## SQL more queries

Building on the first project, here we focused on creating users, granting privileges, joins, and subqueries in mysql.  
All the questions were done on `mysql-5.7`.  
The following SQL statements were used:  
- `SHOW GRANTS`  
- `CREATE` user
- `GRANT` some privileges on some databases, tables for some user.  
- `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY` and `FOREIGN` `KEY` constraints.  
- `JOIN`, retrieve values from multiple tables.  

Do not forget to use `IF NOT EXISTS` or `DROP IF EXISTS`, or more generally to deal with already existing users, databases, tables.  
***
`mysql-5.7` was installed with `sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.7` on ubuntu trusty
