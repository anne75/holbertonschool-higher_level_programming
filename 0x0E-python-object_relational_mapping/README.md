## MySQLdb & mysqlAlchemy
Connecting python with a mysql database.  
For this project, we used 2 ways to connect to query a MySQL database from a python script.  
First we used the `MySQLdb` module and wrote SQL statements.  
Then we used the `sqlachemy` ORM module and only used a more pythonic object notation.
