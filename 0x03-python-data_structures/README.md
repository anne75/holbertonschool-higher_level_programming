#First project around sequences in Python
This project is about manipulating `list`s in Python, including list comprehension, and `tuples` with tuples packing and unpacking. Since this project teaches us to learn the basic lists functions, exception handling was explicitely forbidden. 
The following problems were solved:  
0. Write a function that prints all integers of a list.  
1. Write a function that retrieves an element from a list.
2. Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.  
3. Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.  
4. Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.  
5. Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.  
6. Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.  
7. Write a function that adds 2 tuples.  
8. Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.  
9. Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list. (do no use `max()`)  
10. Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.  
11. Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.  
12. Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b (do not use a temporary variable)  
13. Create a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
